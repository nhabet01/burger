<ul>
<li>Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.</li>
<li>Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured</li>
<li>Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.</li>
